## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first Workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Although this challenge looks easy, it was kinda hard because I'm not into animations, so I had to develop myself to use animations and transitions. Thankfully, I could complete it. I feel like I won a competition everytime a complete Frontend Mentor chanllenges. I hope I can grow even more with Vue and it's techs.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Guides](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me build the animation during hover.
